## Vocabulary: 
sinusoidal function: Any periodic function whose graph has the same shape as that of or 𝑦 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛 𝑥 𝑦 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠 𝑥 

## Analyzing a problem
Students from Simone’s graduating class went on an exchange trip to China and rode the Star of Nanchang, one of the tallest Ferris wheels in the world. Simone graphed the sinusoidal function that represented the ride

1. State the y-intercept. What does this value represent in context of the situation? 
y = 2
beginning of the ride, rider gets on the ferris wheel 2m above the ground

2. State the maximum value of the graph. What does this value represent in context of the situation? 
160 
max height of ferris wheel

3. State the range of the graph. What does this value represent in context of the situation? 
2<=y<=160

4. State the amplitude of the graph. What does this value represent in context of the situation? 
79 (158 / 2) 
radius of the ferris wheel

5. State the equation of the midline. What does this value represent in context of the situation? 
81 (79 + 2)
center of ferris wheel
6. State the period of the graph. What does this value represent in context of the situation? 
p = 30 min
time to make full rotation  

7. How long does it take to get to the top of the Ferris wheel from the bottom? 
15 min (p / 2)

8. How long is the rider above 120 meters during the first rotation of the Ferris wheel?
10 mins


## Example 1
The equation ℎ(𝑡) = 75 𝑠𝑖𝑛 (0.068𝑡 − 1. 56) + 76 represents the turning of a Ferris wheel. The t represents the time (in minutes) and h is the height (in metres). 

a Sin (bx + c) + d
a = amplitude
d = midline
b = period

a) What is the radius of the Ferris wheel? 
75m
a val = 75

b) How high is the bottom of the Ferris wheel from the ground? 
1m 
76 - 75
d - a


c) What is the maximum height of the Ferris wheel?

midline + amplitude
76 + 75 = 151m


d) How long does it take the Ferris wheel to go around one time?
p = 2pi / 0.068
92 mins

e) How high is a car 22 minutes into the ride?
71

f) When is one car on the Ferris wheel at 100m for the first time?
28

g) How long, to the nearest tenth, is the Ferris wheel above 100 m during the first revolution?
64 - 27

## practice


a Sin (bx + c) + d
a = amplitude
d = midline
b = period

a) 
equation of midline: y = 3.5
amplitude: 1.5
period: 13 - 1 = 12

b) Explain what the amplitude represents in this situation.
midpoint of tidal wave

c) Explain what the y-intercept represents in this situation.
start of midnight 

d) Estimate the times of the day the depth of the water is exactly 3 metres.


3. compare parameters a b d
a: left has larger wheel has bigger radius
b: same period for both since T=2pi / b
d: center height is higher for the larger wheel 


4. The function , where T is the temperature in °C and d the day of𝑇(𝑑) = 11. 5 𝑠𝑖𝑛(0. 02𝑑 − 1) + 6. 2 the year, can be used to predict the daily maximum temperature in Grande Prairie, Alberta. 

a) period for the function, to the nearest day, is 314 
d = day of year
P = 2pi / b
b = 0.02
2pi / 0.02 = 314.1592.....

b) T(214) = 11.5 sin(0.02(214) - 1) + 6.2 = 4.6C

ans: B, 4.6C

c) T(d) > 15

163 - 93

number of days where temp >= 15 = 70

![[Pasted image 20250923105000.png]]
a) max height of the horse is __ ft
5

b) time it takes for the horse to return to its original pos, to the nearest sec is __
considering original starting pos is on midline...
time it takes = 2nd midline intersect - 1st midline intersect
2.5 - 1
= 1.5

c) average height of the horse is __ ft
average height = midline
midline = 2 ft

The minimum number of months, to the nearest tenth of a month, it takes for the average temperature of the town to rise from 5 ºC to 15 ºC is 

x = months
y = temp

average temp = 15y int - 5y int

4.3 - 3

average temp of town to rise from 5 -> 15 is 1.3 months
