1. state the regression equation using your calc. round all vals to nearest tenth
y = a sin(bx+c) + d
a = 13.1
b = 0.5
c = -2.1
d = 9.8

find max:
d (midline) + a (amp) 
9.8 + 13.1
= 22.9

min = d - a 
9.8-13.1
= -3.3deg

mid line
y = 9.8
represents yearly average temp

amp = a
a = 13.1

y-int 
initial temp on jan 1

period = 2pi / b
where b = 0.5

(in radian)
2pi / 0.5
= 12.6


how long is the average temp above 15c
![[Pasted image 20250923123427.png]]
9.5 - 5.2
= 4.3

if average increases by 2c
d val would inc by 2
d = 9
d + 2 = 11
will make midline go up

## practice

### a) state the sinreg rounding all vals to 2 dec places
y = a sin(bx+c) + d
a = 2.12
b = 0.02
c = 1.82
d = 6.57

### b) find min and max
d +- a

max = d+a 
6.57 + 2.12
= 8.69

min = d-a
= 4.45

### c) find median
(max + min) / 2
(8.69 + 4.45) / 2

median = 6.57
represents average sunrise time 

### d) state amptitude using vals from b)
(max - min) / 2
(8.69 - 4.45) / 2
= 2.12

represents early or late the sunrise was compared to the max and min times

### e) determining period using max and min points
period =  2 * (max - min)
8.69 - 4.45
= 8.48

### f) time of sunrise on day 163
to find:
int with x = 163

### g) day(s) where sun rises above 8:30

![[Pasted image 20250923125716.png]]
days (considering its 2025)
jan 18 (day 18)
sep 27 (day 270)
nov 28 (day 332)



![[Pasted image 20250923130301.png]]
### a) state sinreg round to nearest tenth
y = a sin(bx+c) + d

a = 21.65
b = 0.54
c = -2.30
d = 2.62

### b) length of period
![[Pasted image 20250923130757.png]]
max average = 20 
min average = -18
distance from max to min = ~12 months
period length = 12.0

represents full year of seasonal temp changes in winnipeg
