## Notes
Radial measure is an alternative way to express the size of an angle. One radian measure is approximately 60 degrees

Using radians allows you to express the measure of an angle as a real number without units. 
So, if we express the measurement of an angle in degrees,  must write the degree symbol (°)

Ex. 75° represents 75 degrees
100 represents 110 radians

The central angle formed by one complete revolution in a circle is 360°, or 2pi in radian measure.
Since, 360° = 2pi, then 180° = pi

converting from degrees to radians, we mult the angle by pi / 180°

ex: convert 135° to radians
1.24 * (180° / pi) = 71°

## Example 1

a) 90°
1pi / 2

b) 120°
2pi / 3

c) 225°
1.25
5pi/4

d) 330°
1.833...
11pi / 6

## Example 2
pi / 4 = 180/4 = 45°
5pi / 6 = (5 * 180)/6 = 150°
4pi / 3 = (4 * 180)/3 = 240°
3pi / 2 = (3 * 180)/2 = 270°

## Example 3
what angle is bigger: 3pi or 8

3pi = 9.4

3pi > 8
