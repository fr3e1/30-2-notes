# Vocabulary
[[Line of best fit]] - A straight line that best approximates the trend in a scatter plot.

[[Curve of best fit]] - A curve that best approximates the trend of a scatter plot.

[[Regression equation]] - Equation of the line or [[Curve of best fit]] that results from a statistical analysis of data.

[[interpolate]] - The process used to estimate a value within the [[Domain]] of a set of data, based on a trend.

 [[extrapolate]] - The process used to estimate a value **outside** the [[Domain]] of a set of data.
