- the value or the highest exponent in the function
	ex. "x^2 + x + 3" has a degree of 2
## Polynomial Shapes by Degree

### 1. Degree 1 (Linear)

Example:

f(x)=2x+3f(x) = 2x + 3f(x)=2x+3

- Shape: a straight line.
    
- Positive slope → rises left to right.
    
- Negative slope → falls left to right.

### 2. Degree 2 (Quadratic)

Example:

f(x)=x<sup>2</sup>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>f(x)=x<sup>2</sup>

- Shape: parabola.
    
- Positive coefficient → opens **upward** (U-shape).
    
- Negative coefficient → opens **downward** (∩-shape).
    

---

### 3. Degree 3 (Cubic)

Example:

f(x)=x<sup>3</sup>f(x) = x<sup>3</sup>f(x)=x<sup>3</sup>

- Shape: “S” curve.
    
- Positive coefficient → falls left, rises right.
    
- Negative coefficient → rises left, falls right.

### 4. Degree 4 (Quartic)

Example:

f(x)=x<sup>4</sup>f(x) = x<sup>4</sup>f(x)=x<sup>4</sup>

- Shape: like a parabola, but flatter or with wiggles.
    
- Positive coefficient → both ends up.
    
- Negative coefficient → both ends down.

### 5. Higher Degrees (n ≥ 5)

- **Odd degree**: one end down, one end up (like cubic but more turns).
    
- **Even degree**: both ends same direction (like quadratic/quartic but more turns).
    
- **Max turns**: at most _degree – 1_.
