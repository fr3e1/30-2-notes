### collective Responsibility
* [[Collective responsibility]] - rules of conduct that members must follow 
#### Two aspects
* group's responsibility for all the actions of all its individual member -> Group punishment or reward because of the actions of one
* Individuals have a responsibility to the group rather than to themselves

### Picture this...
You have been given $100 million, what would you do with it?
* invest it
* spend it all
* give some away

* Not everyone has the same amount of money or quality of life
* This gap can be referred to as a disparity of incomes

### In Canada...
* There is not much economic equality but instead, "sharing of the wealth" comes from government funded social programs
	* For example, Employment Insurance
* Canadian society integrates the values of collectivism and individualization
#### Results... 
* This made people angry
* Lots of wealth, for few

Working class affected most:
* Pollution
* Urban crowding
* Dangerous working conditions
##### This growing gap between rich and poor lead to new political ideas

### Enter Mr. Karl Marx...
* German Philosopher and Revolutionary 
* "the rich will do anything for the poor to get off their backs" 
* did not believe in one oppressing another, or ownership of property
* his proposed solution? Stage a revolution

### Collectivist and Public Property 
* Public Property is anything owned by the state and managed according to the best interests of society; property controlled by the state for the common good of the collective.
	* Addresses the issue of economic inequality
	* Provides motivation; workers have a stake in the success of the business or project
* Mark- workers profit from their own labour, therefore should collectively own factories and businesses, "Abolition of private property"

### Pause and Reflect
#### Brainstorm a list of all of your private property. How would your life be different if all private property was abolished?
