### Roots of collectivism in Politics
* Rousseau - The Social Contract, living in society has a social contract with others in society
* Individuals voluntarily give up their own self-interest to follow the collective will of society
	* encourages liberty and equality among individuals, because everyone has chosen it.
* Rousseau's thinking influenced the development of modern democracy as well as socialism and communism

* Hobbes- social contract again, but people are brutal to each other
	* man vs man
* Believed that people gave power to a government in order to govern in everyone's interest and avoid constant conflict with one another

* Karl Marx- The Communist manifesto, proposed a classless society, in order to unite workers and take control of industries and property for the common goo
* (opposite of capitalism)

### Collective interest

* [[Collective interest]] - A goal or ideal that all members of a group pursue what benefits the whole group
	* possibly sacrifice personal goals or interests; self interest efforts are looked down upon or punished
	* individual excellence welcomed only if it benefits or does not harm the group

### Collective expression in Canadian Politics
can you think of some?

### collective Responsibility
* [[Collective responsibility]] - rules of conduct that members must follow 
#### Two aspects
* group's responsibility for all the actions of all its individual member -> Group punishment or reward because of the actions of one
* Individuals have a responsibility to the group rather than to themselves

### Picture this...
You have been given $100 million, what would you do with it?
* invest it
* spend it all
* give some away

* Not everyone has the same amount of money or quality of life
* This gap can be referred to as a disparity of incomes

### In Canada...
* There is not much economic equality but instead, "sharing of the wealth" comes from government funded social programs
	* For example, Employment Insurance
* Canadian society integrates the values of collectivism and individualization
#### Results... 
* This made people angry
* Lots of wealth, for few

Working class affected most:
* Pollution
* Urban crowding
* Dangerous working conditions
##### This growing gap between rich and poor lead to new political ideas

### Enter Mr. Karl Marx...
* German Philosopher and Revolutionary 
* "the rich will do anything for the poor to get off their backs" 
* did not believe in one oppressing another, or ownership of property
* his proposed solution? Stage a revolution

### Collectivist and Public Property 
* Public Property is anything owned by the state and managed according to the best interests of society; property controlled by the state for the common good of the collective.
	* Addresses the issue of economic inequality
	* Provides motivation; workers have a stake in the success of the business or project
* Mark- workers profit from their own labour, therefore should collectively own factories and businesses, "Abolition of private property"

### Pause and Reflect
#### Brainstorm a list of all of your private property. How would your life be different if all private property was abolished?

## Public Property in Canada
* Formed to serve the common good 
* What is public property here in canada?
* crown land
* crown corporations
	* CBC
	* VIA rail
	* Canada Post
		* if it goes down, it can cause mass disruptions
* hospitals
	* prioritization
	* need to pay
* schools
	* hard to afford
* roads
* ##### What is the benefit of the government owning and managing some property in the interest of citizens?
	* convenience in exchange for money

### Pause and Reflect
* What other collectivist based communities exist in Canada?
* How do these communities express their collectivist values?
* 

### Privatization of Natural Resources
#### Who owns water?
What is going on in Bolivia?
* The government gave water control to two companies, causing the price for water to tank up, making water expensive and harder to access by citizens

The Canadian government shouldn't be able to privatize water access as the companies controlling the water will easily jack up the prices, making water more expensive and less accessible to everyone. Water is an essential human need and should not be privatized for profit, but instead should be easily accessible to everyone. 

#### What is the middle ground to ownership?
The government shouldn't control how much water people can access 

### What is a cooperative
* A co-operative is an enterprise that is owned and operated be a group of people for their mutual benefit and provides services to its members
* 4/10 Canadians belong to a cooperative

#### Can you think of co-operative examples? 
* daycares
* health care centers
* stores
* credit unions

#### What are the advantages of a co-op? Disadvantages?
#### What values are important to its members

### "All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten"
These are the things I learned
Share everything
play fair
dont hit people
put things back where you found them
clean up your own mess
Don't take things that aren't yours
say you're sorry when you hurt somebody
- Robert Fulghum

### Social Expressions of Collective Responsibility
* As mentioned in the political expression of collective responsibility, as well as having political implications, collective responsibility can also have important social implications.
* Co-operation means to work together to accomplish common goals
* Co-operation is an important value in collectivist thinking; when individuals put the goals of the group ahead of their personal goals and when public property is shared to some extent by everyone, people are demonstrating a social expression of collective values.
* #### What do you do when you see bullying?
	*  Do you step in, or turn away?

Stepping in and stopping bullying is a collective responsibility.
In 2002, the Canadian government launched a national anti-bullying public-awareness campaign

* "By taking a collective stand against this behaviour in our schools and communities and working earl on, we can change things for the better. Intervening early in a positive and proactive manner holds the greatest promised for reducing bullying and preventing the escalation of future victimization and offending behaviour."

* #### In what other ways is collective responsivility reflected in our society?
* Think about the responsibilities you have as a member of a neighbourhood or community, student of a school, and citizen of a province.


## Symbolism
 Cartooonists use simple objects, or symbols to stand for larger concepts or ideas

 After you identify the symbols in a cartoon, think about what the cartoonist intends each symbol to stand for.

* #### Exaggeration
* sometimes cartoonists overdo, or exaggerate, the physical characteristics of people or things in order to make a point. 
When you study a cartoon, look for any characteristics that seem overdone or overblown. (facial characteristics and clothing are some of the most commonly exaggerated characteristics.) Then, try to decide what point the cartoonist was trying to make through exaggeration

* #### Labeling 
* Cartoonists often label objects or people to make it clear exactly what they stand for
Watch out for the different labels that appear in a cartoon, and ask yourself why the cartoonist chose to label that particular person or object. Does the label make the meaning of the object more clear?

* #### Analogy 
* an analogy is a comparison between two unlike things that share some characteristics. By comparing a complex issue or situation with a more familiar one, cartoonists can help their readers see it in a different light. 
* After you've studies a cartoon for a while, try to decide what the cartoon's main analogy is. What two situations does the cartoon compare? Once you understand the main analogy, decide if this comparison makes the cartoonist's point more clear to you

* #### Irony
* Irony is the difference between the ways things are and the way things should be, or the way things are expected to be. Cartoonists often use irony to express their opinion on an issue. 
* when you look at a cartoon, see if you can find any irony in the situation the cartoon depicts. If you can, think about what point the irony might be intended to emphasize. Does the irony help the cartoonist express his or her opinion more effectivelyl?
