## Jobs
* #### Have you ever had a job? If yes, how were your wages determined? Ex. Minimum wage, union, employer, negotiation between you and the employer
	I have gained a job. Wages were determined by the amount of experience you had, but you always start with minimum wage. 
	
* #### What do you like about your job? What do you dislike?
	I like how applying for the job is simple and straight-forward, and how the work environment is managed. Friendly coworkers, easy manager to talk with, and work environment is easy to work with.
	
* #### Does your workplace have a union? How do you feel about unions or lack of them in your workplace?
	No. Personally, I do not care much about a union at my workplace due to it being entry-level, minimum wage, and it is locally owned.

## Consumerism
* #### What was the last good or service that you purchased? Where and how did you make the purchase? In a store, online, over the phone, etc.
	
	
	
* #### A purchase is a choice. What else could you have done with your money instead of making this purchase? Why did you decide to purchase this product?
