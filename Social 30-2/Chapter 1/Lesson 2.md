## Jobs
* #### Have you ever had a job? If yes, how were your wages determined? Ex. Minimum wage, union, employer, negotiation between you and the employer
	I have gained a job. Wages were determined by the amount of experience you had, but you always start with minimum wage. 
	
* #### What do you like about your job? What do you dislike?
	I like how applying for the job is simple and straight-forward, and how the work environment is managed. Friendly coworkers, easy manager to talk with, and work environment is easy to work with.
	
* #### Does your workplace have a union? How do you feel about unions or lack of them in your workplace?
	No. Personally, I do not care much about a union at my workplace due to it being entry-level, minimum wage, and it is locally owned.

## Consumerism
* #### What was the last good or service that you purchased? Where and how did you make the purchase? In a store, online, over the phone, etc.
	Personally, I bought a $15 internal cable replacement for a laptop. I made the purchase through an online seller.
	
* #### A purchase is a choice. What else could you have done with your money instead of making this purchase? Why did you decide to purchase this product?
	I chose to purchase this product as I need it to make my device work properly so I can continue working on my school and job work. I could have saved up the money for a coffee and donut on my favorite coffee shop, but it would only benefit me on the moment of eating. This cable would benefit me for years until I decide to replace the entire device as my laptop is very important to me.

## Drivers license
* #### Do you have a driver's license? If no why not. If yes explain what you had to do to get the license.
	I possess a license as of 09-08-25, and I had to complete a learner's test, and a road test to get from unlicensed to a class 5 motorist.

* #### Who decided the process that would be used to license drivers?
	I believe the government decided the process.

* #### Have you ever had to pay a fine related to your driving or parking. Who made the rules that caused the fine to occur? 
	As of 09-08-25, only fine I have ever paid that is related to my driving is the fee to do the road tests and learners test. 

## Are the videos about economic systems or political systems?
#### Economic systems deal with the production and distribution of goods and services. They also deal with:
* how prices and wages are determined
* the levels of taxation and government spending
* ownership of businesses (government or private individuals)

#### Political systems deal with how government decisions are made and what individuals or groups have power and how power is exercised
* How are government leaders chosen
* how much power do they have
* what limits are there on the power of government
* to what extent are individual rights protected
* is this system based on the characteristics of democracy or the characteristics ideas of dictatorship

## Ban big sodas? Nanny state amok in Bloomberg's NY

#### Nanny state:
* A state taking care of its individuals
* Left side of the spectrum

##### “An issue is a question or situation that requires people to make a choice or decision An issue is a question that involves responsible action. Does the concern about large sodas qualify as an Issue? Explain.

Yes, it qualifies as an issue as it requires a decision to be made for the health and safety for the people of NY. This issue has pros and cons of whichever option is chosen - ban big sodas or not. 

##### Which perspective on this issue would you associate with individualism? 

Do not ban big sodas - let people take care of themselves and let them decide on their own what is good for their health. People have the freedom to their own body, and they can choose to buy and drink a soda that is over 16oz.

##### Which perspective on this issue would you associate with collectivism? 

Ban the big sodas - people should be taken care of and if it means banning big sodas to make your people more healthy, it should be done. 

##### What is your opinion about limiting the size of soft drinks? Explain why? 

Personally, I think banning big sodas would be a huge waste of time and effort. Buying big sodas is not a huge enough issue for the government to care much about our own health. Policing this ban would also waste officer's times and efforts, slowing them down. Our body, our choice.

##### Look at the chart on the top of page 9 in your text book and consider the information we’ve looked at: Which side do you find more appealing the collectivist or individualist? Justify your answer. 

Personally I find them both equally appealing. Although having individual rights, I think we could also help out each other or get help from the government to ensure everyone has an equal chance in life as not everyone is fully capable of being completely individual.
