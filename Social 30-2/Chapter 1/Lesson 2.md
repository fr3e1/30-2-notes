## Jobs
* #### Have you ever had a job? If yes, how were your wages determined? Ex. Minimum wage, union, employer, negotiation between you and the employer
	I have gained a job. Wages were determined by the amount of experience you had, but you always start with minimum wage. 
	
* #### What do you like about your job? What do you dislike?
	I like how applying for the job is simple and straight-forward, and how the work environment is managed. Friendly coworkers, easy manager to talk with, and work environment is easy to work with.
	
* #### Does your workplace have a union? How do you feel about unions or lack of them in your workplace?
	No. Personally, I do not care much about a union at my workplace due to it being entry-level, minimum wage, and it is locally owned.

## Consumerism
* #### What was the last good or service that you purchased? Where and how did you make the purchase? In a store, online, over the phone, etc.
	Personally, I bought a $15 internal cable replacement for a laptop. I made the purchase through an online seller.
	
* #### A purchase is a choice. What else could you have done with your money instead of making this purchase? Why did you decide to purchase this product?
	I chose to purchase this product as I need it to make my device work properly so I can continue working on my school and job work. I could have saved up the money for a coffee and donut on my favorite coffee shop, but it would only benefit me on the moment of eating. This cable would benefit me for years until I decide to replace the entire device as my laptop is very important to me.

## Drivers license
* #### Do you have a driver's license? If no why not. If yes explain what you had to do to get the license.
	I possess a license as of 09-08-25, and I had to complete a learner's test, and a road test to get from unlicensed to a class 5 motorist.

* #### Who decided the process that would be used to license drivers?
	I believe the government decided the process.

* #### Have you ever had to pay a fine related to your driving or parking. Who made the rules that caused the fine to occur? 
	As of 09-08-25, only fine I have ever paid that is related to my driving is the fee to do the road tests and learners test. 

## Are the videos about economic systems or political systems?
#### Economic systems deal with the production and distribution of goods and services. They also deal with:
* how prices and wages are determined
* the levels of taxation and government spending
* ownership of businesses (government or private individuals)

#### Political systems deal with how government decisions are made and what individuals or groups have power and how power is exercised
* How are government leaders chosen
* how much power do they have
* what limits are there on the power of government
* to what extent are individual rights protected
* is this system based on the characteristics of democracy or the characteristics ideas of dictatorship
