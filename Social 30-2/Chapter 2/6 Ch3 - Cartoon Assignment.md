	Yes. To fully understand the cartoon, you would have to be familiar with the situation involving George Floyd, BLM, and the police brutality related to it. Anyone who are familiar with the situation would easily recognize it as related to the BLM protests.

	The cartoonist used a reference that is near the timeline when this was relevant, which in this case was the COVID-19 situation. This can be proven by the masks and a reference to the isolations by the first speech bubble on the left frame.

	•	What issue is this political cartoon about?

It appears to be portraying the point of views Albertans and Ottawans have about Alberta. Even though Albertans see themselves as strong and "carrying" Canadians and the economy, Ottawans sees Alberta as highly dependent on pipelines and seemingly in need of it considering the desperation from the dog on the cartoon. 

	•	What is the cartoonist’s opinion on this issue?
I belive the cartoonist's opinion on the issue is through the eyes of an Ottawan. Considering the right side of the cartoon is specifically mentioning Ottawa, I believe the cartoonist is trying to make a point that Alberta is highly dependent on Ottawa's pipes and pipelines to function as a country. I believe this opinion is based off the construction of the pipelines, and [Alberta is urging Ottawa to follow through on the pipelines]("https://www.ctvnews.ca/edmonton/article/we-need-more-opportunities-alberta-urges-ottawa-to-follow-through-on-pipelines/") and Ottawans believe Alberta is only doing it to gain more from Ottawa.


	•	What other opinion can you imagine another person having on this issue?

	•	Did you find this cartoon persuasive? Why or why not?
Yes. The appealing visuals and easy-to-understand messaging easily persuades me and gets me to be on the side of Ottawans due to Alberta basically sucking Ottawa's resources for our own gain.

I believe the cartoonist's opinion on the issue is MAGA is easily influenced or fed lies given by the right wing media, and how easy it is for MAGA to be tricked onto believing something that is not true.

	•	What issue is this political cartoon about?
The issue on the political cartoon is about how stimulus checks and unemployment reliefs are causing an increase in unemployment, and businesses would not offer higher pay and better benefits. 

	•	What is the cartoonist’s opinion on this issue?
I believe the cartoonist's opinion on the issue is minimum wage businesses are not worth getting into due to the stimulus checks and unemployment reliefs are more beneficial for the citizen, which is causing problems for the businesses, causing increased unemployment
