## Social Expressions of Individualism
Modern society places a great deal of importance on the rights and freedoms of the individual. But does every individual have the same advantages and disadvantages?

Some people's freedom may be limited due to:
* Skin color
* Physical/mental illness
* gender
* sexual orientation

### There's a big difference between classical liberals and modern liberals

* Classical liberals believe that less government intervention means greater freedom for all individuals

* They also believe that some government intervention is required to ensure that all individuals have the same level of freedom.

### For example, how could someone living in poverty be free in the same way as someone who can afford education and health care?


* Historically, some liberals pushed for free healthcare for those living in poverty, where others pushed for free healthcare for everyone


So  how much government intervention is enough?
